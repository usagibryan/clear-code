from Introduction to GUIs in Python with PyQt5 by Clear Code - https://youtu.be/8jrEVihl-E4 (rewatch starting at 18:28 to better understand calculator logic)

Changes made:
- Added decimal point button
- Disabled user from typing in field

- Delete key clears the field

Improvements to make:
- crashes if you press enter when the field is empty or an operator is at the end
- does not keep form when you resize it
- add history
- add more features such as exponents, square roots, change sign buttons, etc.
