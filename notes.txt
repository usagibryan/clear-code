GUI calculator created in Python with PyQt5

from Introduction to GUIs in Python with PyQt5 by Clear Code - https://youtu.be/8jrEVihl-E4 (rewatch starting at 18:28 to better understand calculator logic)

Improvements to make:
- crashes if you press enter when the field is empty or an operator is at the end
- crashes if you enter something other than a number
- does not keep form when you resize it
- if you enter the numbers and operators with the keyboard into the field then hit enter it crashes
- make it so that you can just use the numpad
